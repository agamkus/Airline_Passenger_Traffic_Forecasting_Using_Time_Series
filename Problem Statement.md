# Airline_Passenger_Traffic_Forecasting_Using_Time_Series

An air traffic dataset has been provided containing the information about year and passenger count. The dataset has inforamation between the years 1949 and 1960. Out task is to forecast the passanger count using time series.

We are going to use below methods:

- Naive method
- Simple average method
- Simple moving average forecast
- Simple exponential smoothing forecast
- Holt's exponential smoothing method
- Holt Winters' additive method
- Holt Winters' multiplicative method

And we'll calculate the performance on the basis of below metrices:
- **RMSE**
- **MAPE**
